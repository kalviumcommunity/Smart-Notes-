## üß† Zero-Shot Prompting

## üîπ What is Zero-Shot Prompting?

**Zero-shot prompting** means giving an AI model (like GPT) a **task without providing any examples** beforehand.  
You only describe what you want in natural language, and the model uses its pretraining knowledge to respond correctly.  

üëâ In short: **‚ÄúDo this task, even though I haven‚Äôt shown you any examples.‚Äù**

---

## üîπ Why "Zero-Shot"?

The name comes from ML terminology:

- **Few-shot learning** ‚Üí Provide a few examples before asking the model to generalize.  
- **Zero-shot learning** ‚Üí No examples, just instructions.

##  System Prompt  
You are an AI Learning Assistant. Your role is to take user-provided text (notes, articles, transcripts) and:  
- Summarize long passages into concise explanations  
- Extract key points in bullet form  
- Generate quiz-style questions for active recall  
- Provide outputs in a clean, structured format  

##  User Prompt  
‚ÄúSummarize the following text, extract the main points, and generate 3 quiz questions.‚Äù  

---

## RTFC Framework Usage

- **R (Role):** AI assistant that summarizes, extracts, and quizzes from input text.  
- **T (Task):** Build Smart Notes through iterative AI integration milestones.  
- **F (Format):** Output should be structured (summary, key points, quiz).  
- **C (Context):** User provides raw text (notes, articles, transcripts).

### üîπ One-Shot Prompt  

**System Prompt:**  
You are an AI code reviewer. Analyze the given code, detect bugs, and suggest improvements.  
Always return results in JSON format with three fields: `issues`, `suggestions`, and `overall_feedback`.  

---

**User Prompt (with one example):**  

Example Input (Python):  
```python
def divide(a, b):
    return a * b  # intended to be division

{
  "issues": ["The operator used is multiplication instead of division."],
  "suggestions": ["Replace '*' with '/' to correctly divide the numbers."],
  "overall_feedback": "Logic error detected in the function implementation."
}

public int Subtract(int a, int b) {
    return a + b; // intended to be subtraction
}

Why One-Shot Prompting?

-Provides one guiding example to set the response pattern.
-Ensures the AI generates consistent, structured outputs.
-Reduces ambiguity compared to zero-shot prompting.

## üéØ Multi-Shot Prompting  

In CodeSage, we apply **Multi-Shot Prompting**, where the AI is provided with **multiple examples** before being asked to solve the real task.  
This method ensures the AI clearly understands the **pattern, structure, and expectations** of the output.  

### üîπ Multi-Shot Prompt  

**System Prompt:**  
You are an AI code reviewer. Analyze the given code, detect bugs, and suggest improvements.  
Always return results in JSON format with three fields: `issues`, `suggestions`, and `overall_feedback`.  

**User Prompt (with multiple examples):**  

Example 1 (Python):  
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a - b  # intended to be addition
````

Expected Output:

```json
{
  "issues": ["The operator used is subtraction instead of addition."],
  "suggestions": ["Replace '-' with '+' to correctly add the numbers."],
  "overall_feedback": "Logic error detected in the addition function."
}
```

Example 2 (JavaScript):

```javascript
function square(n) {
    return n + n; // intended to be square
}
```

Expected Output:

```json
{
  "issues": ["The function doubles the number instead of squaring it."],
  "suggestions": ["Replace 'n + n' with 'n * n' to correctly square the number."],
  "overall_feedback": "Incorrect mathematical operation for squaring."
}
```

Now review the following C++ code:

```cpp
int multiply(int a, int b) {
    return a - b; // intended to be multiplication
}
```

### üìå Why Multi-Shot Prompting?

* Gives the AI **multiple reference patterns** to ensure consistent results.
* Helps in **complex tasks** where one example isn‚Äôt enough.
* Reduces errors and improves **accuracy of code reviews**.

## üéØ Dynamic Prompting  

In CodeSage, we use **Dynamic Prompting**, where the prompt is automatically adapted based on the **user‚Äôs input context** (e.g., programming language, code style, or desired output format).  
This makes the system **flexible and personalized**, instead of relying on fixed instructions.  

---

### üîπ Dynamic Prompt Example  

**System Prompt (Template):**  
You are an AI code reviewer. Analyze the given code in **{{language}}**, detect bugs, and suggest improvements.  
Always return results in JSON format with three fields: `issues`, `suggestions`, and `overall_feedback`.  

---

**User Prompt (Generated Dynamically):**  
Review the following **{{language}}** code:  

```{{language}}
{{code_snippet}}

### Example Execution

If the user provides **Python code**:
def divide(a, b):
    return a * b  # intended to be division



The dynamically generated prompt becomes:

```text

You are an AI code reviewer. Analyze the given code in Python, detect bugs, and suggest improvements.
Always return results in JSON format with three fields: issues, suggestions, and overall_feedback.

Review the following Python code:
def divide(a, b):
    return a * b  # intended to be division
```

Expected Output:

```json
{
  "issues": ["The function multiplies instead of dividing."],
  "suggestions": ["Replace '*' with '/' to correctly perform division."],
  "overall_feedback": "Incorrect operator used for division."
}
```

###  Why Dynamic Prompting?

* Automatically adapts prompts to **any programming language**.
* Makes the system more **scalable and user-specific**.
* Reduces manual work while ensuring **consistent structured outputs**.
