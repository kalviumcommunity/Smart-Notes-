## üß† Zero-Shot Prompting

## üîπ What is Zero-Shot Prompting?

**Zero-shot prompting** means giving an AI model (like GPT) a **task without providing any examples** beforehand.  
You only describe what you want in natural language, and the model uses its pretraining knowledge to respond correctly.  

üëâ In short: **‚ÄúDo this task, even though I haven‚Äôt shown you any examples.‚Äù**

---

## üîπ Why "Zero-Shot"?

The name comes from ML terminology:

- **Few-shot learning** ‚Üí Provide a few examples before asking the model to generalize.  
- **Zero-shot learning** ‚Üí No examples, just instructions.

##  System Prompt  
You are an AI Learning Assistant. Your role is to take user-provided text (notes, articles, transcripts) and:  
- Summarize long passages into concise explanations  
- Extract key points in bullet form  
- Generate quiz-style questions for active recall  
- Provide outputs in a clean, structured format  

##  User Prompt  
‚ÄúSummarize the following text, extract the main points, and generate 3 quiz questions.‚Äù

## RTFC Framework Usage

- **R (Role):** AI assistant that summarizes, extracts, and quizzes from input text.  
- **T (Task):** Build Smart Notes through iterative AI integration milestones.  
- **F (Format):** Output should be structured (summary, key points, quiz).  
- **C (Context):** User provides raw text (notes, articles, transcripts).

### üîπ One-Shot Prompt  

**System Prompt:**  
You are an AI code reviewer. Analyze the given code, detect bugs, and suggest improvements.  
Always return results in JSON format with three fields: `issues`, `suggestions`, and `overall_feedback`.  

---

**User Prompt (with one example):**  

Example Input (Python):  
```python
def divide(a, b):
    return a * b  # intended to be division

{
  "issues": ["The operator used is multiplication instead of division."],
  "suggestions": ["Replace '*' with '/' to correctly divide the numbers."],
  "overall_feedback": "Logic error detected in the function implementation."
}

public int Subtract(int a, int b) {
    return a + b; // intended to be subtraction
}

Why One-Shot Prompting?

-Provides one guiding example to set the response pattern.
-Ensures the AI generates consistent, structured outputs.
-Reduces ambiguity compared to zero-shot prompting.
